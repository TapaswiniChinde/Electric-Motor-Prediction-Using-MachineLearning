# Electric-Motor-Prediction-Using-MachineLearning
🔥 Electric Motor Temperature Prediction System 📌 About the Project

This project focuses on predicting the operating temperature of an electric motor using Machine Learning techniques. Electric motors are widely used in industries, and abnormal temperature rise may lead to performance issues or equipment failure.

By analyzing sensor data such as speed, torque, voltage, and current, this system predicts motor temperature to support early fault detection and maintenance planning.

🎯 Project Goals

Build ML models to estimate motor temperature

Reduce the risk of overheating

Improve operational reliability

Support predictive maintenance in industrial environments

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Multiple regression models were implemented and evaluated to improve prediction accuracy:
